- The system must read the people.csv file √
- For each person that is found in the file it will:
    o Generate a CPR similarly to how a normal CPR looks: ddMMyyy-[random-4-digits] √
    o Build an xml body that contains the first name, last name and CPR number √
    
    o Send a POST request to http://localhost:8080/nemID with the XML as a body
    o The NemID system will return a JSON body:
    
    o An msgpack file will be created with the name [CPR].msgpack which will contain f_name,
    l_name, birth_date[DD-MM-YYYY], email, country, phone, address, CPR and NemID
    number. I suggest you make a JSON object and then serialize it.
